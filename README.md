# Software-Egineering---Internal-Assessment-System
The goal of this project is to create an automated system for internal assessment for three year undergraduate students of Delhi University. This software will capture attendance, project/assignment marks, test marks and calculate final marks.  The software will be a multiuser system. The expected users of this system will be students, faculty, and admin of the college. The software should enable the students to view their attendance and internal marks in each subject. Faculty should be able to enter attendance and marks of the students they are teaching. Admin should be able to generate different report of internal assessment class-wise. This software will enhance the security features (by using passwords) that are void in the traditional ways of implementation of the information storage.
